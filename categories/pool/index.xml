      <description>Once you decided you want to become an ADA (Cardano) Pool Operator, one of the first technical decisions you have to make is which ports to use for your ADA core node and relay.
Your relay will connect to other Cardano relays and must accept incoming connections from them. Your core node will only connect to your realy and will only accept incoming connections from your relays. Installation guides often propose to use TCP ports 3000, 3001, 6000 or 6001.</description>

      <description>A new relay in Malaysia A Cardano pool needs relays. Malpertus Pool started with a node in Singapore, and two relays in Singapore.
We updated our infrastructure. Our core node is still in Singapore, put we have now public relays in Singapore and Malaysia. For availability reasons, we also have private relays in Canada and France.
Happy Staking!</description>
