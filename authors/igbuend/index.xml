      <description>As a Cardano Stake Pool Operator (SPO) you are responsible for the health and security of the Cardano network. As a first step, access to your node or relay must be protected with at least two factor authentication (2FA), based on something you know (like a passphrase) and something you have (like a certificate on your laptop).
The most common tool used to remotely administer a Linux server is SSH. It is by default installed on Linux workstations or servers, and recent versions of Windows 10 include it as an optional component.</description>

      <description>Welcome to pool.malpertus.com!
This is a new project for us. We just deployed our first Malpertus Cardano Staking node.
It is a small node, but we are in it for the long run, since we want to support the Cardano project and give it the effort it needs.
Since we are based in Singapore, we will do our best to expand the Cardano network in South East Asia. Currently our node is in Singapore, with two public relay servers in Singapore, and one private relay server in Canada.</description>
