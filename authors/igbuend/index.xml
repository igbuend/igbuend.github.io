      <description>Once you decided you want to become an ADA (Cardano) Pool Operator, one of the first technical decisions you have to make is which ports to use for your ADA core node and relay.
Your relay will connect to other Cardano relays and must accept incoming connections from them. Your core node will only connect to your realy and will only accept incoming connections from your relays. Installation guides often propose to use TCP ports 3000, 3001, 6000 or 6001.</description>

      <description>A new relay in Malaysia A Cardano pool needs relays. Malpertus Pool started with a node in Singapore, and two relays in Singapore.
We updated our infrastructure. Our core node is still in Singapore, put we have now public relays in Singapore and Malaysia. For availability reasons, we also have private relays in Canada and France.
Happy Staking!</description>

      <title>Generate Secure and Future-Proof SSH Keys</title>

      <description>As a Cardano Stake Pool Operator (SPO) you are responsible for the health and security of the Cardano network. As a first step, access to your node or relay must be protected with at least two factor authentication (2FA), based on something you know (like a passphrase) and something you have (like a certificate on your laptop).
The most common tool used to remotely administer a Linux server is SSH. It is by default installed on Linux workstations or servers, and recent versions of Windows 10 include it as an optional component.</description>

      <description>Welcome to pool.malpertus.com!
This is a new project for us. We just deployed our first Malpertus Cardano Staking node.
It is a small node, but we are in it for the long run, since we want to support the Cardano project and give it the effort it needs.
Since we are based in Singapore, we will do our best to expand the Cardano network in South East Asia. Currently our node is in Singapore, with two public relay servers in Singapore, and one private relay server in Canada.</description>
