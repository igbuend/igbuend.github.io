<h2>Bio</h2>
<p>I am Herman, also known as <strong>igbuend</strong>. I wrote code on a TI58 calculator, a ZX Spectrum and an Amiga. I installed Slackware Linux from 24 floppy disks, my first Usenet post was on 24 September 1990 and it went all downhill from that moment onwards. I am a former developer, security consultant and PCI auditor.  Now just a hacker.</p>
